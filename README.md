# Inovus Certificate Validator
This is a basic Certificate Validator developed to showcase and prove the authenticity of various certificates issued by Inovus Labs IEDC. 
The certificates are dumped onto a Google Drive and the details of the certificate awardees are stored in a Google Sheet and is accessed using [**Google Sheets API**](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api).
